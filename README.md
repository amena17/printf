# C-programming printf partner project

[ALX C-Programming Group Project #1](https://github.com/SEBLEWONGELG/printf.git)
## This repo contains the group project "printf" with associated tasks:
0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life:
	* Write a function that produces output according to a format.
		* Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);
		* Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
		* write output to stdout, the standard output stream
		* format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:
			* c
			* s
			* %
		* You dont have to reproduce the buffer handling of the C library printf function
		* You dont have to handle the flag characters
		* You dont have to handle field width
		* You dont have to handle precision
		* You dont have to handle the length modifiers
1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't:
	* Handle the following conversion specifiers:
		* d
		* i
		* You dont have to handle the flag characters
		* You dont have to handle field width
		* You dont have to handle precision
		* You dont have to handle the length modifiers
2. Just because it's in print doesn't mean it's the gospel:
	* Create a man page for your function.
		* file: man_3_printf
